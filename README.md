# Calvin's dotfiles

dotfiles for the Soul

## Note

These dotfiles is based off [Zach Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), more specifically from [1b430b7](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/tree/1b430b72e4e098a9902ff8435c08655c28db1edd).
The instructions found in his [readme](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/1b430b72e4e098a9902ff8435c08655c28db1edd/README.md) should also apply here as well.

## Differences from Holman's dotfiles

- Similar, but not quite the same, Brewfile
- Some dotfiles and functions (e.g. cloudapp) have been removed
- rvm is used instead of rbenv as the ruby version manager
- nvm is used as the node version manager
- Different prompt
