# Calvin's dotfiles

dotfiles for the Soul

## Note

This dotfiles is based off [Zach Holman's dotfile](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), more spefically from [1b430b7](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/tree/1b430b72e4e098a9902ff8435c08655c28db1edd).
The instructions found on his [readme](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/1b430b72e4e098a9902ff8435c08655c28db1edd/README.md) should also apply to this as well.

Some of the dotfiles have been removed, and rvm is used instead of rbenv to manage ruby versions.

## Installation

```
# To install:
$ git clone
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ script/bootstrap

# To update, should be ran from time to time:
$ dot
```
